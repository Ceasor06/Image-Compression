Image compression is minimizing the size in bytes of a graphics file without degrading the quality of the image to an unacceptable level. 
The reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space.
It also reduces the time required for images to be sent over the Internet or downloaded from Web pages.
There are numerous picture compression algorithms available . Among all of these algorithms, in this project I used
